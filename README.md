# Birth of Sky Budget Cuts

## Overview

Due to budget cuts, parachutes may not be available on the Birth of Sky heist.

- 90% chance that Locke only provides parachutes for half the crew.
- 10% chance that Locke cheaps out and doesn't give you any parachutes at all.

Additional information:

- Parachutes do not respawn.
- Players who join the lobby will be sent an announcement message if you have not left the plane yet.
